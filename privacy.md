This privacy policy covers how this blog treats personal information
it receives from visitors.

## How Do You Guarantee Privacy?

Although not a perfect guarantee, since this blog doesn't require 
registration, there really isn't much information to share in the first place.

## What Information Do You Collect?

This blog itself doesn't collect any data. It's a static site hosted on GitHub Pages.
However, we do use some third-party site tools, so it's worth looking at their privacy policies:

* [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html). 
* [Disqus](http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466259-privacy-policy).


## What About Cookies?

See the previous answer about Disqus and Google Analytics.

## Who Do You Share This Information With?

Absolutely nobody, other than occasionally posting aggregate stats about our blog on occasion.
